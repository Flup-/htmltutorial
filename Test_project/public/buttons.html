<h1>How to code a buttons:</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Basic Button</h2>
<p>The button tag is easy:<br><code>&lt;button&gt;Cool Button&lt;/button&gt;<br></code>This creates a basic empty button like so:<br><button>COOL BUTTON</button></p>
<hr />
<h2>Buttons in action:</h2>
<p>This is actually quite simple and is effectively done in one line:<br><code> &lt;a href="index.html"&gt;&lt;button&gt;Home&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code><br>This seems super complicated but its not so bad. Let's Break it down:</p>
<p>To begin, it is place in an anchor tag which is simply making sure that it has a hyperlink attached to the button. href="index.html" refers to the html page that you started on. Then it is nothing but the basic button tag wrapped up in that anchor.<br>This is it in action:<br><a href="index.html"><button>Home</button></a><br>The button has many different uses to explore, this is just one example.</p>
