<h1>How to insert images.</h1>

<h2>We are going to learn how to put this amazing picture into your HTML.</h2>
<img src="/images/smiles.jpg" alt="Smiley face">
<p>The image tag, &lt;img&gt; has two required attributes: src and alt. src gives the source to the html in order to find the file and alt provides additional information if for some reason the file cannot load.</p>
<p>The code is fairly simple and looks like this:<br><code>&lt;img src="/directory/filename.extension" alt="further info"&gt;</code><br>You can also set the width and height with width="X" and height="Y". As you can see, the image tag does not end with &lt;img&gt;.<br>The code for the above image looks like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;img src="/images/smiles.jpg" alt="Smiley face"&gt;</code><br>The tag is made and the first thing that it does is source the file in my HTML project's images folder. Then it adds the alt and boom its there. Simple as that.</p>
<p>Images can also be sourced from websites through anchors that will redirect pages images to yours.</p>
